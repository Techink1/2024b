    <p>Dodder is an annual weed that is difficult to control and that is highly damaging to crops. It is a parasitic plant that likes to grow in moist, wet conditions. Dodders form large colonioes that can wipe out crops such as:</p>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Asparagus</li>
    <li>Melons</li>
    <p>You can control this weed by hand removal and pruning.

    <h3>Scientific name- Rumex crispus</h3>
    <p>Curly dock is a perennial weed that prefers to grow in moistened soils. They grow in pastures, roadsides and crop fields. Curly docks have a membranous sheath and bulging stem joints. These leaves grow two to five feet in length witrh wavy edges. Flowers of curly dock appears in clusters on stalks which develop at the top of the leaves. The best way to control the curly dock is by mowing down the area regularly. Because curly dock is a native plant, controlling by hand digging can be difficult.

The leaves are long and thin, resemble blades of grass and have notches at their base where they attach to the stem. The leaves are usually yellowish green to lime green in color, making them reasonably easy to spot. Crabgrass is very difficult to control once it has germinated. The weed thives in moist soil conditions, which causes its seeds to germinate quickly after the surface breaks by cultivation or rainfall. Crabgrass is easy to identify and to pull once it has been located around your garden or yard. Proper mowing also helps to eradicate this weed. In addition, remember not to overwater your lawn as moist conditions are perfect for crabgrass germination.</p>

Clovers spread quickly and prefer areas with thin or no vegetation cover, such as cultivated fields or abandoned farmlands. They creep along the ground and thrive in nitrogen starved-soils. Identifying this weed on your lawn may indicate poorly supplied nitrogen into the soil. Once established, it is challenging to eliminate, so preventive measurea are best with these types of weeds.

There are two species of chickweed, namely the Common Chickweed and Sticky Chickweed. This weed is also a common problem for landscape and turf grasses. Chickweed germinates when soil temperatures reach between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but growth slows as soil temperatures reach 60 degrees Fahrenheit. It thrives in moist soils and low-fertility environments.</p>
    <h2>Bindweed</h2>
